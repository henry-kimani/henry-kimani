### 👋 Hi, I’m Henry a self-taught developer

<hr></hr>

### Preface

From the title i am a self-taught developer, i do it for fun and as hobby.
And have a :moneybag: billion :dollars: start-up idea, waiting for execution, :no_entry_sign: can't tell you 
signed an NDA :joy:.

🌱 I’m currently learning web development. <br>
Am familiar with the following technologies :wrench: but soon to change
and adding more, since am still learning.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- I also know i little bit of Python :snake:, Java :coffee: and C
- Sqlite3

I have use the following frameworks and library
- React framewo... i mean library ( useEffect() :gun: :pill: )
- Django :disappointed:, despite this framework having a large community, i don't
like the developer experience.
- Express :dash: 
- Typescript :cupid:

- Am really not good with backend, but am really confident with frontend
development. But as i said, this will change, it a matter of learning.🌱


### :dart: Goal

I want to learn :pushpin: Next js since i already learnt react and i like the DX
from some of the knowledge :memo: i have compiled.

I also want to learn Svelt and SveltKit too, i have seen its comparison with react 
and as the CEO i will learn it.

And anything i that catches my eye :eyes:, anything that is IT. :computer:

 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on javascript related projects
